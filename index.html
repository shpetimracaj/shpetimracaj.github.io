                            <p>Throughout my Computer Science program, I have developed a range of technical skills that are reflected in the projects I selected for my capstone. These projects demonstrate my ability to solve problems, implement software solutions, and improve existing systems.

                                For the first project, I chose a C++ artifact that simulates a pyramid using 3D graphics. The original version introduced basic 3D modeling concepts, but I enhanced it by adding more realistic lighting and textures, and allowing user interaction. I also included a data table to display information about the pyramid's properties, making the project more interactive and informative.
                                
                                For the second project, I implemented an algorithm to improve the efficiency of searching and updating contacts. The focus was on reducing the time complexity and making the system more responsive. This enhancement ensures the application performs better, especially when dealing with larger datasets, and aligns with the course's standards for algorithmic performance.
                                
                                The third project is an Android app for tracking user weight data, using an SQLite database. The enhancement I made was adding a dashboard that provides graphs and summary statistics to help users better understand their progress. This update improved both the functionality and user experience of the app, highlighting my ability to integrate database management with front-end development.
                                
                                These three projects demonstrate my growth in key areas such as programming, software design, and problem-solving, as well as my commitment to producing high-quality, maintainable code.</p>

                            <p>The artifact I chose for this milestone is the pyramid problem implemented in C++. Initially created as part of an earlier assignment, this code simulates a pen using 3D graphics. It provides a basic structure to visualize geometric shapes and their properties.</p>

                            <p>I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it showcases my skills in C++ programming and graphics rendering. The original implementation demonstrated fundamental concepts of 3D modeling; however, I recognized opportunities for enhancement. In this enhancement, I added more lighting textures, allowing for a more realistic visual representation of the pyramid. I also enabled user interaction with the pen, enhancing the overall experience. Additionally, I integrated a table to display relevant data about the pyramid's dimensions and properties, making the output more informative. The improved comments throughout the code facilitate better understanding and maintainability.</p>
                            <p>Enhancing this artifact was a rewarding learning experience. Through the process, I gained a deeper understanding of lighting techniques in 3D graphics and how they impact visual realism. Additionally, adding user interaction helped me explore event handling and responsiveness within graphical applications. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the new features worked seamlessly without compromising the existing functionality. I overcame this by thoroughly testing each enhancement incrementally, ensuring that any changes made were integrated smoothly. This experience has further solidified my ability to adapt and improve existing codebases while enhancing user experience.</p>

                            <p>The artifact I selected for enhancement is a database application developed for tracking user weight data, originally created as part of my Android development coursework. This project utilized an SQLite database to store user data, including weight entries and timestamps. The primary purpose of this application is to help users monitor their weight over time, providing a platform for tracking progress and promoting healthy habits</p>

                            <p>This artifact is from the CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming final project. For this project we were given three options to design and create an Android application. I chose to create an app that allows the user to utilize CRUD operations in a daily weight tracker that would also display the delta from a user defined goal weight. This project was originally created in March of 2024.</p>
                            <p>In Module One, I outlined my goals for this course, focusing on improving my ability to create interactive applications and effectively utilize databases. With this enhancement, I have successfully met these course outcomes by implementing a dashboard that enhances user interaction and experience. The dashboard not only showcases my technical skills but also emphasizes my understanding of data visualization principles. I am satisfied with the coverage of my initial outcome plans, as the enhancements align well with my goals. </p>
